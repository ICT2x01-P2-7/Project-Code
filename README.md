## Introduction

Project McQueen is a fun and interactive web portal to allow students to create their own challenges on a real life car. The web portal stimulates critical and logical thinking in students by forcing students to think of a way to get their car to the finishing line in the least amount of turns as possible. Critial and logical thinking is an important skill in programming and we hope to introduce students to programming in a fun and meaningful way with Project McQueen.

## How To Run

- keep it straight to the point of how to access the entry point of the web app
- any necessary dependencies to run it

In order to run our application, make sure python 3.9 is installed on your system and execute the following command.

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

This will install all requirements that are needed for the application. Finally, execute the following command to start the server.

python3 app.py

This will start the server. Navigate to localhost:5000 to view the web app.

## Development Workflow

## User Acceptance Testing

- Include an updated use case diagram and system state diagram if there are changes made based on M2. Highlight the changes clearly.
- An embedded video that runs through all the system test cases you have created (and refined) from M2
- ~3 mins long to cover all system tests

## Whitebox Testing

- choose one meaningful class to demonstrate your test code. “Meaningful” here means 2 or more interactions with other classes, e.g., a Control class. Please do not use an Entity class.
- list the test cases for this test suite (for this one class) and where they reside in your repo
- show code coverage statistics for each test case, including an explanation of how you have generated these statistics (whether manual, through a lib, or via the IDE)
- provide instructions how to run the test suite
- embed an animated gif or another short video (~1 min) of the test case being ran
