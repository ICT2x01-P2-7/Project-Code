## Introduction

Project McQueen is a fun and interactive web portal to allow students to create their own challenges on a real life car. The web portal stimulates critical and logical thinking in students by forcing students to think of a way to get their car to the finishing line in the least amount of turns as possible. Critial and logical thinking is an important skill in programming and we hope to introduce students to programming in a fun and meaningful way with Project McQueen.
